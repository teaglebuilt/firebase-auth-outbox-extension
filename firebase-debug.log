This directory now contains the source files for a simple extension called greet-the-world. You can try it out right away in the Firebase Emulator suite: first, compile your code by running:

npm run build --prefix=functions

Then, navigate to the functions/integration-test directory and run:

firebase emulators:start --project=<project-id>

If you don't have a project to use, you can instead use '--project=demo-test' to run against a fake project.

The integration-test directory also includes an end to end test (in the file integration-test.spec.ts) that verifies that the extension responds back with the expected greeting. You can see it in action by running:

npm run test

If you want to jump into the code to customize your extension, then modify index.ts and extension.yaml in your favorite editor. 

If you want to deploy your extension to test on a real project, go to a Firebase project directory (or create a new one with firebase init) and run:

firebase ext:install ./path/to/extension/directory --project=<project-id>
firebase deploy --only extensions

You can find more information about building extensions in the publisher docs: https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/publishers/get-started
